PRD implementation status (high level):
- Backend CR workflow, revisions, merge, diff, and review endpoints: implemented.
- Permissions: merge restricted to Wiki Manager/Approver/System Manager; review actions limited to reviewer or manager/approver.
- Change request APIs for “my CRs” and “pending reviews”: implemented.
- Frontend CR view/diff integration: implemented (DiffViewer via @pierre/diffs), routes swapped from contributions -> CRs.

Tests:
- Added/updated CR permission tests and merge/review tests.
- Ran: bench --site wiki.localhost run-tests --app wiki --module wiki.frappe_wiki.doctype.wiki_change_request.test_wiki_change_request (passing)

Outstanding / next-most-important from PRD:
- Enforce “no direct Wiki Document edits” across APIs/UI (removal or guardrails).
- Background jobs: outdated CR marking + merge queue.
- Conflict resolution workflow (persist/resolution endpoints & merge retry).
- Clean up legacy contribution UI/API and permissions.
