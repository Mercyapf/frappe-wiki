The Cluster Coordinator will play a central role in coordinating, demonstrating, observing, supporting and managing all aspects of the creche operations from the very begiining in sync with the Program Manager. 

In cases where Program Manager is not part of the Program, the Cluster Coordinator may have to play the role of a Program Manager as well as may be decided by the Organizations. The roles and responsibilities of a Cluster Coordinator cannot be very different from a supervisor. The only difference is that a supervisor is responsible for 10 creches will be lot more deeply involved in all creche operations whereas a Cluster Coordinator will be responsible for 40 creches (maximum) and hence slightly less deeply involved.

It is important that the Logistic Coordinator studies the organization policies well and goes through list of materials needed for the creche operations. 

During the exposure visit to a running center, it is desirable and advisable that the person observes the set of materials at a running centers to gain an insight of what all are needed and of what quality. A logistic Coordinator is ideally responsible for many creches (100 or more) but it is only prudent to see the limit to which he/she can stretch.

# **Creche Caregivers**


Creche Caregivers are central to the creche operations. They play a critically important role in driving the creche operation daily. It is therefore important that we illustrate their roles and responsibilities comprehensively to accommodate all aspects of creche operations and make it is a reference for them and other cadres to base their interventions around.  


The Caregivers roles and responsibilities have been captured in the form of work and actions (we will refer them as Practices) they will be performing daily starting from opening of the creche in the morning to closing of the creche in the evening. Kindly refer the [Caregivers’ Practices section](https://crecheprotocols.m.frappe.cloud/creche/3-capacity-building#32-caregivers---practices) to gain an insight into their roles and responsibilities.
