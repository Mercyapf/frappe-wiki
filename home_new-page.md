## Malnutrition in India
32.9% of Indian children under 5 are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398423002373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stunted, with wasting at 18.7%</a> reflecting chronic undernutrition prevalent nationwide.

Rural areas show higher rates: NFHS-5 data indicates stunting at around 37% for children under 3 in rural India, exceeding urban figures by 5-10 percentage points. Among rural areas, the crisis is especially severe among Adivasi communities.

Public systems provide take home rations, immunization, and other services during Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Days (VHSND) and referral to health facilities in case of illnesses. However many children  have poor access to many of these services based on  ground realities and geographical distances/barriers.

## Safe spaces for children under 3 

The aganwadi system typically provides physical safe spaces to children starting at the age of 3. Creches in the public system are a fraction of the demand. Therefore, families with children under 3 years face significant challenges with child care and support. Often, older siblings (usually girls) are forced to drop out of school to take care of younger children. Mothers struggle with participation in the workforce in the absence of safe spaces for children. In many contexts children are left with neighbours or other family members in unsafe spaces. 

## The Azim Premji Foundation Creche Initiative

Our creche initiative provides safe, nurturing spaces for children aged 7 months to 3 years. The program is community centric, with a high level of operational detailing around aspects including safety, quality nutrition and community engagement. We aim for spaces that have plenty of light, ventilation and are convenient for communities to bring their children.  

We partner with grassroots NGOs that manage these creches. These organizations maintain strong community presence in vulnerable geographies which face significant challenges in child health and nutrition.

We began the program in Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and expanded subsequently to Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. While we currently support ~1300 creches, the program is continuously expanding. We also support creches in informal settlements in cities (beginning with Bengaluru and Raipur) and have plans for expansion of the urban creche program as well. 

## Civil Society Creche Interventions in India

In many ways our creche program has been built upon pioneering efforts of civil society interventions around creches in India. The program was heavily influenced by the phulwaris run by <a href="https://www.jssbilaspur.org/creches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jan Swasthya Sahyog</a> in Ganiyari, Bilaspur and the learning from the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289442293_Combating_Malnutrition_A_Process_Document_of_Action_Against_Malnutrition_A_Multi-Strategy_Intervention_in_Seven_Blocks_of_Four_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Action Against Malnutrition</a> project. The Azim Premji Foundation supported the Public Health Resource Society to run 150 creches in 5 districts in South Odisha in 2016 (these creches continue to operate till date),and in 2022-23 decided to expand the program to a much larger initiative. In the process we have completely overhauled the operating guidelines for running creches based on our ground level understanding that we have developed.
