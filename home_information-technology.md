# INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

INTRODUCTION:
Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and
manipulate data or information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as
opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information
and communications technology (ICT).
Information System
An information system is a set of interrelated components that collect, manipulate, store
data and disseminate information and provide a feedback mechanism to monitor performance. An
Information system (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational system designed to collect,
process, store, and distribute information. In a sociotechnical perspective, information systems are
composed by four components: task, people, structure (or roles), and technology.
Computer and System
A computer system is a set of integrated devices that input, output, process, and store data
and information. Computer systems are currently built around at least one digital processing
device. There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, Processing,
Storage, Output and Communication devices
